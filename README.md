"# Primitive-calculator" 
A primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with the current number n: 
1) add 1 to n 
2) multiply n by 2 
3) multiply n by 3. 
Given a positive integer n, the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n starting from the number 1 is found. The output contains two parts - the number of minimum operations, and the sequence to get to n from 1.

Example:
Enter n:20
n=20
op_num=4
sequence=3 3 1 2
